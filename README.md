📌 Project Title

NLP Text Classification System (Python & Flask)

📖 Project Description

This project is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) based text classification system developed using Python.
It uses machine learning techniques to preprocess text data, extract features, train a model, and predict text categories.
A simple Flask web interface is also included for testing the model.

🚀 Features

Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization)

TF-IDF feature extraction

Machine Learning model training

Prediction on new/unseen text

Flask-based web interface

Easy to use and extend

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3

Flask

Scikit-learn

Pandas

NumPy

NLTK
